Self's foundational abstractions.

<a href="https://github.com/booch-self">Self</a> is a hybrid neuro/symbolic architecture for AGI. At its foundation are seven abstractions upon which all of Self's structure and behavior are built: Concept, Property, Relationship, Ontology, Blackboard, and Agent (plus one more meta abstraction, SelfException). Together with these abstractions are a set of inherent concepts, each of which builds on the foundational abstractions and collectively which provide a common vocabulary at a slightly higher level of abstraction for the purpose of making various important systemic patterns manifest. All of these abstractions are implemented in several different programming languages (<a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/source/python">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/source/java">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/source/c++">C++</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/source/Swift">Swift</a>) as well as a set of <a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/microservices">microservices</a> (which may be deployed to any containerized platform that runs in the cloud as well as on the edge, all orchestrated by Kubernetes). Unit tests for these abstractions may be found <a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/tests">here</a> along with a <a href="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/tests/validation">validation suite</a>.

## Architectural Principles
  
There are six principles that shape the architecture of Self's foundational abstractions:

* Mindful systemic behavior emerges from a constellation of mindless agents.

This is Minsky's concept of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Society-Mind-Marvin-Minsky/dp/0671657135">The Society of Mind</a>. There are many consequences to this architectural principle, the most important of which are that agents are reified to be the system's elementary units of behavior and so are designed to communicate opportunistially via blackboards (using a pub/sub mechanism) as well as deterministically via a mesh (using peer-to-peer signals and channels).

* Assume that a system's knowledge of its outer context, the representation of that knowledge, and the knowledge of the system's inner state are incomplete, contradictory, multi-modal, sometimes intractable, and often wrong.

This is Brook's concept of <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/representation.pdf">intelligence without representation</a>. There are many consequences to this architectural principle, the most important of which are that embodiment is treated as a necessary reality and that societies of agents are designed to work at different levels of abstractions (in what is called a subsumption architecture), yielding behavior that rises along a spectrum of agency from System 1 to System 2, using Kahneman's concept of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>.

* Every system possesses a small set of inherent concepts.

This is Marcus's concept of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05667.pdf">innateness</a> and is made further manifest with the <a href="https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/314767.174.pdf">ontological concepts</a> of Storga, Marjanovic, and Andereasen. There are many consequences to this architectural principle, the most important of which are the presence of a sufficient but necessary set of innate abstractions and mechanisms (sufficient in the sense that they offer a vocabulary expressive enough to address a wide spectrum of domain knowledge and systemic behavior; necessary in the sense that while it can be assumed that every one of these innate concepts could evolve organically , we choose to not wait the several million years - in software time, that is - for a system to evolve them from the void).

* Strange loops are the catalyst for yielding the illusion of highly complex behavior.

This is Hofstadter's concept first expressed in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GÃ¶del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">Godel, Escher, Bach</a>. The primary consequence of this architectural principle is that Self's foundational abstractions are intentionally self-referential, making possible reflective knowledge and reflective action.

* There must exist a clear separation of concerns between the logical and physical elements of the system.

The primary consequences of this architectural principle are to enable run-time replaceability of agents and ontologies, to make possible the implementation of agents and ontologies in any number of programming languages, to yield relatively transparent placement on and migration of artifacts across the edge and the cloud, and to relegate the complexity of concurrency to be a systemic mechanism, not a local one to which every artifact would have to attend.

* Assume deployment at scale across an underlying computational fabric that is unreliable and insecure.

The primary consequence of this architectural principle is a decision to use encrypted microservices across containerized artifacts; coupled with the principle of strange loops, this means that - to the greatest degree possible - a system's computational fabric is known to the system itself.

## Self Concepts

<img src="https://github.com/booch-self/self-concepts/tree/master/Documentation/Images/self_concepts.png" alt="self_concepts">

There are seven abstractions upon which all of Self's structure and behavior are built.

    Concept
    Property
    Relationship
    Ontology
    Blackboard
    Agent
    
    SelfException

### Concept
  
Concept is Self's central abstraction. Everything is a Concept (and even a Concept is considered to be a kind of Concept). The primary responsibilities of a Concept are to name an abstraction and to define its characteristics.

    attributes:
    
        name
        properties
    
    methods:
    
        addProperty
        removeProperty
        removeAllProperties
    
        propertyExists
        numberOfProperties
    
        iterateOverProperties

Attributes are protected so as to ensure a proper separation of concerns between interface and implementation. Type checking of names is not enforced; type checking of properties and property classes are strictly enforced.

### Property

Property is a Concept defining a name/value pair. Dictionaries are a common way of representing key/value pairs, but Property is a subtly different abstraction: a Property reifies a name/value relationship, making it possible to define different Property classes and to manipulate individual Property instances. The primary responsibility of a Property is to define some characteristic of another Concept

   attributes:
    
        value

 The attribute is protected so as to ensure a proper separation of concerns between interface and implementation. Type checking of value is not enforced.

### Relationship

Relationship is a Concept defining the connection between two other Concepts or Concept classes, each edge of which may have its own Properties. The primary responsibility of a Relationship is to define the meaning of how two Concepts or Concept classes are connected to one another.

    attributes:
    
        edge1
        edge2
        edge1Properties
        edge2Properties
    
    methods:
    
        addPropertyToEdge
        removePropertyFromEdge
        removeAllEdgeProperties
    
        edgePropertyExists
        numberOfEdgeProperties
    
        iterateOverEdgeProperties

Attributes are protected so as to ensure a proper separation of concerns between interface and implementation. Type checking of edges, properties, and property classes are strictly enforced.

### Ontology

Ontology is a Concept defining a collection of Concepts together with their Relationships. An Ontology is guaranteed to be closed (a Relationship can only refer to a Concept that is part of that Ontology) and complete (a Relationship cannot have a dangling edge). An Ontology is sometimes ephemeral (meaning that its state persists only for the lifetime of its parent) but most often is meant to define a more permanant artifact (one whose state persists across time). The primary responsiblities of an Ontology are to define the vocabulary, the meaning, and/or the state of particular domain.

    attributes:
    
        concepts
        relationships
    
    methods:
    
        addConcept
        removeConcept
        removeAllConcepts
    
        conceptExists
        numberOfConcepts
    
        iterateOverConcepts
    
        addRelationship
        removeRelationship
        removeAllRelationships
    
        relationshipExists
     
        numberOfRelationships
    
        iterateOverRelationships
    
        conceptIsBound
        numberOfUnboundConcepts
        numberOfBoundConcepts
    
        iterateOverUnboundConcepts
        iterateOverBoundConcepts

Attributes are protected so as to ensure a proper separation of concerns between interface and implementation. Type checking of concepts, relationships, concept classes, and relationship classes is strictly enforced.

### Blackboard

Blackboard is a Concept defining a collection of Concepts, each of which is published by an Actor and each to which an Actor may subscribe, such that the publisher and/or the subscriber can be signaled about interesting events concerning that Concept. An Actor may subscribe to a Concept class, such that when an instance of that Concept class is published by some Actor, a subscription to that Concept is made manifest. A Blackboard is guaranteed to be closed subscriptions can only refer to a Concept or a Concept class that is part of the Blackboard). A Blackboard is generally ephemeral (meaning that its state persists only for the lifetime of its parent). The primary responsibility of a Blackboard is to define a bounded context for a society of Actors who wish to collaborate around the state space of a shared collection of Concepts.

    attributes:
    
        concepts
        conceptClasses
        publications
        conceptSubscriptions
        classSubcriptions
    
    methods:
    
        publishConcept
        unpublishConcept
    
        publisher
        signalPublisher
    
        conceptExists
        numberOfConcepts
    
        iterateOverConcepts
    
        subscribeToConcept
        unsubscribeFromConcept
    
        subscribers
        signalSubscribers
    
        subscribeToConceptClass
        unsubscribeFromConceptClass
    
        classSubscribers
        signalConceptClassSubscribers

Attributes are protected so as to ensure a proper separation of concerns between interface and implementation. Type checking of concepts, concept classes, publications, and subscriptions are strictly enforced.

### Agent

Agent is a Concept defining a self-directed locus of activity. An Agent is an actor that has identify (it can be distinguished among all other Agents), agency (within its bounded context, it exhibits independent activity), concurrency (it carries out its activity in parallel with all other Agents), and state (it can act and react to as well as alter the state of its contex and/or its internal condition). Agents are typically organized into societies that collaborate with one another around the state space of a shared collection of Concepts as defined by a Blackboard; those societies of agents are typically further organized into nearly independent, hierarchical layers. Agents may communicate directly with one another via synchronous and/or asynchronous channels. An Agent is partly emphemeral (meaning that its state is vibrantly active during its lifetime) and partly permanant (meaning that some internal state may be preserved across invocations of the Agent). The concurrent behavior of an Agent is made manifest at deployment; at the logical level, an Agent neither assumes nor provides any intrinsic mechanisms for threading or for synchronization. The primary responsibility of an Agent is to reify an independent activity.
    
    methods:
    
        activity
    
        start
        stop
        pause
    
        isAlive
        status
    
        signal
        connect

This base class serves to define the essence of every well-formed Agent. As such, its specification is minimal; it is expected to have subclasses that provide attributes, implementations of these base methods, and additional methods. Type checking of parameters, sources, messages, and channels are strictly enforced.

### SelfException

SelfException is a class whose instances are used to report on Concepts that are not well-formed or that behave badly. The primary responsibility of a SelfException is to name the dysfunctional behavior.

    attribute:
    
        errorMessage

The attribute is public. Type checking of the error message is not enforced.
